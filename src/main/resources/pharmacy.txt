Pharmacy is the science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing and monitoring medications,
aiming to ensure the safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines. It is a miscellaneous science as it links health sciences
with pharmaceutical sciences and natural sciences. The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the
drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, pharmacy practice is either classified as community
or institutional pharmacy.
